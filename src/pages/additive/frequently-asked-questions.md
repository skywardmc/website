## Can this cause data corruption?

I say it's very unlikely to cause corruption to world data, however, I would always recommend keeping backups regardless if you're playing with mods. If you want to be extra safe, you can remove ModernFix at a cost of performance and memory usage. You can also remove C2ME if you're running in a server environment, at a cost of chunk generation speed.

## How can I provide feedback?

If you want to talk about the pack or have any questions, please use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/36Tv44cYte)! However, if you are asking for a feature to be added or giving a bug report, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/issues) instead. Thanks!

## Can I make a modpack with this?

Yes, _you can_! Feel free to use this in any way you want! All I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put the Modrinth page in there. Also, I would prefer you not to include this project's name (for example, something like "Additive Plus") or a similar icon (like changing colors of the current icon) in the fork as it could confuse users and can make it seem like I endorse it.

**If you are building a modpack with a large amount of content then I would heavily advise that you base it off [Adrenaline](https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline) instead. Doing so would give you much easier control over the QoL mods available and would prevent mod conflicts. It may also run better.**

**If you're building a modpack off Additive and publishing it, please be sure to change the config on Crash Assistant to match your project, such as the Discord links and strings, along with the modpack creators list. Or just remove Crash Assistant entirely if you don't want to deal with updating the modlist every time.**

If you do make a fork, feel free to let me know and I can add it to the [Credits](/additive/credits) page 😎
