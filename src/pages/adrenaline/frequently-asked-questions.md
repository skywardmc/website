## Can this cause data corruption?

I say it's very unlikely to cause corruption to world data, however, I would always recommend keeping backups regardless if you're playing with mods. If you want to be extra safe, you can remove ModernFix at a cost of performance and memory usage. You can also remove C2ME if you're running in a server environment, at a cost of chunk generation speed.

## Comparisons to other modpacks?

I don't usually like to make benchmarks comparing different modpacks. A _lot_ of factors have to be considered when doing so, and this can lead to misleading benchmarks if not done correctly. However, I _can_ give a general comparison between different modpacks and what features they provide. In this case, I'll compare Simply Optimized, as I get asked about that a lot. If you want to see a comparison between Additive and Fabulously Optimized, see [Additive/Frequently asked questions](/additive/frequently-asked-questions).

Simply Optimized and Adrenaline are fairly similar modpacks, however they do have a few differences.

- **Simply Optimized uses more experimental mods and patches that may be unstable and possibly incompatible with other content mods**. Most notably being [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/project/c2me-fabric) and some experimental patches from ModernFix. This means that SO is slightly faster than Adrenaline, at the cost of being possibly unstable.
- **Simply Optimized gets updated more often**, usually every few days, whereas Adrenaline gets updated bi-weekly (or weekly if there are many changes.)
- **Simply Optimized contains No Chat Reports, despite its goal of being a performance modpack**. Adrenaline does not as NCR is not in-scope.
- **Simply Optimized makes a few changes to the audio settings, FOV, etc.** Adrenaline uses all of the default settings from Minecraft except for the simulation distance.
- **Simply Optimized does not include YOSBR**. This means that your changes to modpack settings get overridden every time you update.

Neither modpack is perfect and both have their pros and cons. You should use the one that is best for your use-case. If you prefer SO having more experimental optimizations, want faster updates, and are okay with No Chat Reports, go for it! If you prefer Adrenaline being a little more stable and having nearly the same amount of performance, consider checking us out instead. Or use a different one or make your own. I don’t really care.

## How can I provide feedback?

If you want to talk about the pack or have any questions, please use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/36Tv44cYte)! However, if you are asking for a feature to be added or giving a bug report, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/issues) instead. Thanks!

## Can I make a modpack with this?

Yes, _you can_! Feel free to use this in any way you want! All I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put the Modrinth page in there. Also, I would prefer you not to include this project's name (for example, something like "Adrenaline Plus") or a similar icon (like changing colors of the current icon) in the fork as it could confuse users and can make it seem like I endorse it.

If you do make a fork, feel free to let me know and I can add it to the [Adrenaline/Credits](/adrenaline/credits) page 😎
