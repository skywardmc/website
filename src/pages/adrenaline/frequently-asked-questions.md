## Can this cause data corruption?

I say it's very unlikely to cause corruption to world data, however, I would always recommend keeping backups regardless if you're playing with mods. If you want to be extra safe, you can remove ModernFix at a cost of performance and memory usage. You can also remove C2ME if you're running in a server environment, at a cost of chunk generation speed.

## Comparisons to other modpacks?

I don't usually like to make benchmarks comparing different modpacks. A _lot_ of factors have to be considered when doing so, and this can lead to misleading benchmarks if not done correctly. However, I _can_ give a general comparison between different modpacks and what features they provide. In this case, I'll compare Simply Optimized, as I get asked about that a lot. If you want to see a comparison between Additive and Fabulously Optimized, see [Additive/Frequently asked questions](/additive/frequently-asked-questions).

Simply Optimized and Adrenaline are fairly similar modpacks, however they do have a few differences.

- **Simply Optimized uses more experimental mods and patches that may be unstable and possibly incompatible with other content mods**. Most notably being [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/project/c2me-fabric) (on the client) and some experimental patches from ModernFix. This means that in some scenarios SO can be a little faster than Adrenaline, at the cost of being possibly unstable.
- **Simply Optimized gets updated more often**, usually every few days, whereas Adrenaline gets updated weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly depending on the amount of changes. This is mostly due to time constraints and I would update more often if I could.
- **Simply Optimized contains No Chat Reports**. Adrenaline does not as NCR is not in-scope.
- **Simply Optimized makes a few changes to the audio settings, FOV, etc.** Adrenaline uses all of the default settings from Minecraft except for the simulation distance.
- **Simply Optimized does not include YOSBR**. This means that your changes to modpack settings get overridden every time you update.

Neither modpack is perfect for everyone - you should use the one that is best for your use-case. If you prefer SO having more experimental optimizations, want faster updates, and are okay with No Chat Reports, go for it! If you prefer Adrenaline being a little more stable and having nearly the same amount of performance, consider taking a look aswell.

## How can I provide feedback?

If you want to talk about the pack or have any questions, please use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/36Tv44cYte)! However, if you are asking for a feature to be added or giving a bug report, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/issues) instead. Thanks!

## Can I make a modpack with this?

Yes, _you can_! Feel free to use this in any way you want! All I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put the Modrinth page in there. Also, I would prefer you not to include this project's name (for example, something like "Adrenaline Plus") or a similar icon (like changing colors of the current icon) in the fork as it could confuse users and can make it seem like I endorse it.

If you do make a fork, feel free to let me know and I can add it to the [Adrenaline/Credits](/adrenaline/credits) page ðŸ˜Ž
