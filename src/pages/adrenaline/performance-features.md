Adrenaline utilizes various performance mods to improve the game's logic and rendering speed significantly. Here is a list of mods that it uses, excluding library mods.

**Adrenaline can be used on both clients or servers. Mods are either client-side, server-side, or both, which is determined by me based on overhead, purpose, and relevance. Here's how it works:**

- If you install Adrenaline through a **launcher**, such as Prism Launcher or the Modrinth App, it will only install the mods that are marked as **client-side** or **both-side**.
- If you install Adrenaline through a **server installer**, such as mrpack-install or Docker Minecraft Server, it will only install the mods that are marked as **server-side** or **both-side**.
