import AdditiveInstallerCard from "../../components/AdditiveInstallerCard.astro";

You can install Adrenaline through our free and open-source installer by clicking the button below. Alternatively, if you want to install Adrenaline through a third-party launcher, follow [Modrinth's documentation](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth).

<AdditiveInstallerCard />

The Additive installer works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. If you can't open the installer, try running `java -jar additive-installer-1.0.3.jar` in a terminal. You need Java installed.

To install Adrenaline instead of Additive in the installer, make sure that you uncheck "Include non-performance features". Keeping this checked will install Additive.

<summary>Installing on Steam Deck</summary>

Using a Steam Deck? You can install Adrenaline on there! This may also work similarly on other handhelds, but I haven't tested. First we'll install Prism Launcher, and then install the modpack.

1. While the deck is turned on and is in Gaming Mode, hold down the power button and select "Switch to Desktop".
2. In the bottom panel, look for the üëú "Discover" app.
3. Press the search bar in Discover, and then press X to open the keyboard.
4. Search for "Prism Launcher", and then tap install.
5. Launch it. When it asks you for the amount of RAM, set the maximum to 4096 MB. Connect your account, and once it's complete, close the launcher.
6. Tap the Steam Deck icon in the bottom panel, and then look for "Prism Launcher". After that, right click Prism, and "Add to Steam".
7. Now, go back to Gaming Mode by double tapping the file on the desktop or opening Steam and switching back.

Prism is now installed. Now, we can install the pack.

1. Launch Prism from Gaming Mode.
2. Tap "Add Instance" in the top left of Prism.
3. Select the Modrinth tab.
4. Press `STEAM` + `X` together to open the keyboard. Then, search for "Adrenaline".
5. Tap on Adrenaline, select your preferred modpack version, and then install.
6. Go into the instance's mods tab and install [Controlify](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlify). Optionally, you may also want to install [Resourcify](https://modrinth.com/mod/resourcify).
7. For the first launch, you will get a notice at the start of the game to download some libraries and calibrate your controller. Simply follow the on-screen instructions and you shouldn't have to do this again.
8. After launching, go to your video settings and enable fullscreen to fix the aspect ratio. Enjoy!

<summary>Installing on servers</summary>

Adrenaline also optionally functions server-side! We now use Modrinth's mrpack environment feature to install the proper mods for the correct environment. Client-side mods that are part of Adrenaline will not be installed through these methods. The server portion of this modpack was previously known as [Adrenaserver](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaserver).

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Install using mrpack-install</summary>

Download `mrpack-install` through [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install/releases) (or your distro's package if it has one) and take a look at the commands on the [README](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install). In Adrenaline's case, to install in your server you would run:

```sh
mrpack-install adrenaline [optional version number]
```

<summary>üêã Install using Docker Compose</summary>

> It's a good idea to have some knowledge on using Docker before doing this.

1. Make sure you have Docker Engine installed properly according to the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
2. Create a new directory
3. Place the contents below in a file called `docker-compose.yml`. This Compose file also contains some other server tweaks meant for performance, such as disabling `sync-chunk-writes`, reducing render and simulation distance, and more
4. Run `docker compose up -d` in that directory

For any other information, you can read through the [Docker Minecraft Server documentation](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io).

```yaml
services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - "25565:25565"
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
      # Adrenaline and other mods
      MOD_PLATFORM: MODRINTH
      MODRINTH_DOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES: required
      MODRINTH_MODPACK: adrenaline # this installs the latest version of Adrenaline, you can also use a specific MR link to a version
      MODRINTH_PROJECTS: spark, chunky # comma separated list of extra mods
      # Server properties
      VIEW_DISTANCE: 8
      SIMULATION_DISTANCE: 5
      SYNC_CHUNK_WRITES: false # having this set to false will significantly improve performance but may cause desync issues and (extremely rare) data corruption. set to true if you don't have a backup system
    volumes:
      # Attach the relative directory 'data' to the container's /data path
      - ./data:/data
```

<summary>‚ú® Install using mcman</summary>

[mcman](https://github.com/ParadigmMC/mcman) is a tool for managing the mods/plugins/configurations of a Minecraft server. First, install mcman from [releases](https://github.com/ParadigmMC/mcman/releases). To import Adrenaline while initializing a server, use this command:

```sh
mcman init --mrpack mr:adrenaline
```

After initializing and importing the mrpack, run `mcman build` to build the server into the `server/` directory, from which you can call `cd server && sh start.sh` or `cd server && call start.bat`. For more information, check out [mcman's docs](https://github.com/ParadigmMC/mcman/blob/main/DOCS.md).

<summary>üíø Install using mrpack4server</summary>

See the [mrpack4server](https://github.com/Patbox/mrpack4server) Git repository for installation info. `modpack-info.json`:

```json
{
	"project_id": "adrenaline",
	"version_id": "version id or name"
}
```

<summary>üßô Install using packwiz-installer</summary>

> Before doing any of this, be sure to have a backup of the server in case anything goes wrong.

[packwiz-installer](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer) is a useful tool that lets you automatically install and update a modpack through the `pack.toml` file of that pack.

Some server hosts may let you set a command that runs before the server actually starts. It's called a pre-launch command. I can't exactly help if you are using an external server provider as many don't support pre-launch commands or require you to supply your own jar file that will run the command.

First, you need to install `packwiz-installer-bootstrap` from [here](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases). After that, move it to the same folder as your server's Fabric loader jar. This will usually be the root of the server.

You may change the MC version of the modpack ([available versions only](https://github.com/intergrav/adrenaline/tree/main/versions)).

```sh
java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar -g -s server https://raw.githack.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/main/versions/fabric/1.21.1/pack.toml
```

If you are running this server through a batch file or shell script, you can add this command before your server's launch command and it should work just fine.

_Having trouble? Check out the [packwiz wiki](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/#using-a-modpack-with-a-server) and, if that doesn't help, ask in the [packwiz Discord server](https://discord.gg/DcSkRF4)._
